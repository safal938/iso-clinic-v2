**RE: URGENT REFERRAL – Marcus "Mark" Elias Thorne**

**PATIENT DETAILS:**
*   **DOB:** August 14, 1978 (46 years old)
*   **Address:** 402 Industrial Pkwy, Apt 4B, Detroit, MI 48201

**Dear Dr. Gupta,**

Thank you for urgently accepting Mr. Marcus Thorne, a 46-year-old male who presented to our office today following a visit to Urgent Care. He presents with **new-onset overt jaundice, severe pruritus, and markedly elevated liver enzymes**. I am referring him to you for immediate evaluation to determine the etiology of this acute liver dysfunction and for further management.

**HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:**
Mr. Thorne states that his wife noticed his eyes turning yellow approximately 2 days ago. He reports intense generalized itching which is disrupting his sleep. He denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever.

*   **Recent History:** He was treated for a dental abscess 3 weeks ago at a walk-in clinic. He finished a course of antibiotics (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate) and has been managing lingering jaw pain with over-the-counter analgesics (Tylenol PM and Extra Strength Tylenol) for the past few weeks.
*   **Social History:** He works in construction. He reports social alcohol use but denies heavy drinking or binge drinking in the recent past.

**PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:**
*   **Vitals:** Stable. Afebrile.
*   **General:** Patient is alert but clearly jaundiced (sclera and skin).
*   **Skin:** Excoriations present on arms and legs.
*   **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender. Liver span appears slightly enlarged on percussion but is not tender to palpation. No ascites noted.

**RELEVANT LABS (From Urgent Care - 24 hours ago):**
*   **Total Bilirubin:** **5.2 mg/dL** (High)
*   **ALT:** **620 U/L** (High)
*   **AST:** **450 U/L** (High)
*   **Alk Phos:** 180 U/L
*   **INR:** 1.2

**CLINICAL IMPRESSION:**
**Severe Acute Hepatitis / Acute Liver Injury of Unknown Etiology.**

I am concerned by the rapid onset of jaundice and the severity of the transaminitis in an otherwise healthy male. The specific cause is currently unclear.
*   **Viral Hepatitis:** Needs exclusion (Hepatitis A, B, C).
*   **Biliary Pathology:** Although the patient lacks typical biliary colic/pain, the elevated Alk Phos and Bilirubin warrant imaging to rule out obstruction.
*   **Metabolic/Other:** Patient has a BMI of 31.5; underlying fatty liver disease may be a contributing factor, though this does not fully explain the acute spike in enzymes.

**PLAN:**
1.  I have advised the patient to stop taking all pain medications (Tylenol) and avoid alcohol immediately as a precaution to protect liver function.
2.  **Referral to Hepatology:** For urgent workup including viral serologies, autoimmune panel, and liver ultrasound to rule out obstructive pathology.

I have attached the preliminary labs from the Urgent Care center. Your expertise in diagnosing this acute presentation is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

*(Electronic Signature)*
